There are collection of directories that include the actual source for this document,and they act as a test suite for the tool.  Each directory will contain:

* A config file, conf.jsonw
* A set of expected keys, in passing-keys.csv
* A human readable explaination of the test case, in input.md

You can play with these yourself, or add items to them.  Run the `tests.sh` command to regenerate this documentation.

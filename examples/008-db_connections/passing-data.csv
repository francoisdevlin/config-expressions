#### Further optimization
#It is possible to optimize this event further with a small change to process.  For example, if we adopt a convention that every db user must be named after the application, we can replace the `*` dictionary with one entry
#
#	"*.*$app_name.db.username" : "DDO_${app_name}_DBA_READ"
#
#This will also remove the need to even maintain a list of usernames in _configuration_, as our pattern file will provide a _convention_ instead.

This example show a basic wildcard match.  It is possible to use a wildcard to match both specified paths, such as app1.db, as well as dynamic paths, such as app9.db.url.  It also shows what happens in the case of a collision.  Notice that app2.db.url returns a different value, `jdbc:h2:/other/path`
